    <p>
        This project is aimed to make the C++ project development experience on linux to feel more like a Visual Studio project. It achieves that simplicity by making use of tasks in Visual Studio Code and creating a new project structure.
    </p>
    </br>
    <h1 style="font-size: 250%">Initialization</h1>
    <p>There are three ways to start using <b style="color: blue;">PufferMake</b>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Building using Visual Studio Code tasks.</li>
        <li>Building using Terminal commands.</li>
        <li>Using the released pre-built binary.</li>
    </ul>
    </br>
    <h1 style="font-size: 150%">Building using Visual Studio Code tasks</h1>
    <p>Download this project and extract it to a folder. Open this folder in Visual Studio Code. At the top menu, go to: </p>
</div>

```
Terminal >> Run Task... >> Build
```

<div>
     <p>This will open a new terminal window on Visual Studio Code and run compilation and linking processes. The binary file will be in the <b>target</b> folder.</p>
     </br>
     <h1 style="font-size: 150%">Building using Terminal commands</h1>
     <p>Download this project and extract it to a folder. Open this folder in terminal and run these terminal commands in the given order.</p>
</div>

```bash
cd objects
```

```bash
g++ -c "../src/main.cpp" "../src/FileList/FileList.cpp" "../src/Configuration/Configuration.cpp" "../src/Maker/Maker.cpp" "../src/ParseCommand/ParseCommand.cpp" -std=c++20 -Os
```

```bash
cd ..
```

```bash
g++ objects/main.o objects/FileList.o objects/Configuration.o objects/ParseCommand.o objects/Maker.o -o ./target/PufferMake
```

<div>
    <p> The binary file will be in the <b>target</b> folder.</p>
    </br>
    <h1 style="font-size: 150%">Using the released pre-built binary.</h1>
    <p>Download the latest release or, for the bleeding edge executable, use the executable in the <b>target</b> folder.</p>
    </br>
    <h1 style="font-size: 250%">Creating the First Project</h1>
    <p>Move the binary named <b style="color: blue;">PufferMake</b> to the folder that you want to create your project in and run one of these commands in that folder. Both does the same thing.</p>
</div>

```bash
./PufferMake
./PufferMake create
```

<p>These commands will create the necessary structure to setup the project. This structure contains these:</p>

```
.vscode/                            -folder
objects/                            -folder
target/                             -folder
src/                                -folder
src/main.cpp                        -file
.vscode/tasks.json                  -file
build.json                          -file
defaults.json                       -file
```
</br>
<h1 style="font-size: 150%">".vscode" Folder and "tasks.json" file</h1>
You should not be changing this folder and its contents manually if you don't know what you are doing. It should provide necessary tasks for <b style="color: blue;">PufferMake</b> to operate and should work as it is.
</br>
</br>
<h1 style="font-size: 150%">"objects" Folder</h1>
This folder will contain the object files that are created after the compilation.
</br>
</br>
<h1 style="font-size: 150%">"target" Folder</h1>
This folder will contain the result of build/link operations. 
<li>If the build type is <b>executable</b> then the result's name will be <b style="color: rgb(50, 170, 70);">app</b> by default.</li>
<li>If the build type is <b>shared</b> then the result's name will be <b style="color: rgb(50, 170, 70);">libapp.so</b> by default.</li>
<li>If the build type is <b>static</b> then the result's name will be <b style="color: rgb(50, 170, 70);">libapp.a</b> by default.</li>
This name can be changed in <b>build.json</b> file.
